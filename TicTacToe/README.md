This is a simple command line tic tac toe game (also known as noughts and crosses) designed to be played by two people. 
To play decide who is O's and who is X's and then run the code. The player's who's turn it is and what pieces are already 
filled on the board will be printed to the terminal. Simply type a number between 1 and 9 that has not already been 
submitted to make your move (a grid showing which number is associated with which position is printed when the code is 
initially run). A message wil be printed to the terminal when someone has won or the game has ended in a tie and then 
the application will terminate.
